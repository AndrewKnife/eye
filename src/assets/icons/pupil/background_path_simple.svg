			perspective of the history of art,[10] artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind: from
			early prehistoric art to contemporary art; however, some theorists think that the typical concept of
			"artistic works" does not fit well outside modern Western societies.[11] One early sense of the definition
			of art is closely related to the older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to "skill" or "craft", as
			associated with words such as "artisan". English words derived from this meaning include artifact,
			artificial, artifice, medical arts, and military arts. However, there are many other colloquial uses of the
			word, all with some relation to its etymology.
			20th-century bottle, Twa peoples, Rwanda. Artistic works may serve practical functions, in addition to their
			decorative value.
			Over time, philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Socrates and Immanuel Kant, among others, questioned the
			meaning of art.[12] Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art: Socrates says that poetry is
			inspired by the muses, and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness
			(drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the Phaedrus (265a–c), and yet in the Republic wants to outlaw
			Homer's great poetic art, and laughter as well. In Ion, Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer
			that he expresses in the Republic. The dialogue Ion suggests that Homer's Iliad functioned in the ancient
			Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literary art that
			can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted.[13]

			With regards to the literary art and the musical arts, Aristotle considered epic poetry, tragedy, comedy,
			Dithyrambic poetry and music to be mimetic or imitative art, each varying in imitation by medium, object,
			and manner.[14] For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates
			with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for
			instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better
			than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation—through narrative or character, through
			change or no change, and through drama or no drama.[15] Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to
			mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.[16]
