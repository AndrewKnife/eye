    <p>According to contemporary sociology, our identity is dual: consisting of stable and changing characteristics.
      Stable ones, such as date and place of birth, native language, ancestors, cultural context in which we grew up,
      genetic code; and changing descriptions, such as belonging to subcultures, field of study, professional interests
      or current mood.
    </p>
    <p>Physical elements determine stable identifiers. The genetic code plays a very important role here, determining
      such features as skin and hair colour, facial features, fingerprints or iris. The iris in the human body changes
      the least and is several hundred times more stable than a fingerprint. It consists of blood vessels that form in
      response to environmental factors in a developing embryo.
    </p>
    <p>If the iris hardly changes in our life course, then the descriptions we give to the body carrying this iris are
      the opposite. Sometimes our favourite music, style of dress or study and professional interests change so much
      that we can look like a different person… We also grow in relation to different people and their cultures and
      become a collection of our environment. When the environment changes - we change too. Our self-concept is
      constantly changing and in close relation with society. It flows like water in a river. Our identity connects
      society. It builds bridges and connects us with each other not through leg length, hair colour or iris shapes, but
      through descriptions that we assign to ourselves today.

      About Installation
    </h2>
    <p>Similar to a person trying to describe their identity, artificial intelligence technology can speak richly about
      the environment and assign identities to the objects there. In this installation, an algorithm that scans the iris
      interprets its physical features and assigns it unchanging keywords, creatively applying the epigenetic theory of
      iris formation. When the analysis is over, artificial intelligence creates a poetic description of the iris -
      haiku. The robot acts like a translator for the iris, speaking out the silent data that lurks there.
    </p>
    <p>Then visitors have the opportunity to compare their iris descriptions with each other and find similarities and
      differences that they did not suspect. Here, ordered connections between individuals are revealed, where physical
      characteristics are much less important than such descriptions of those characteristics.
    </p>
    <p>Combining technologies, science and art into one piece, the authors of the installation invite you to look at
      yourself and others from an unexpected angle. The creative team claims to have sought to combine the monumentality
      of our self with fluid, constantly changing descriptions that build bridges between biologically or nationally
      unrelated individuals. According to them: “the iris is a symbol of eternity, its names are a symbol of change. We,
      as people, are connected by our names and the values and emotions associated with them, which become the
      connecting material of a solidary society. We become ourselves together with our environment, and in this way, we
      all become one.”
