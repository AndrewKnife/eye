    '        perspective of the history of art,[10] artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind: from\n' +
    '        early prehistoric art to contemporary art; however, some theorists think that the typical concept of\n' +
    '        "artistic works" does not fit well outside modern Western societies.[11] One early sense of the definition\n' +
    '        of art is closely related to the older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to "skill" or "craft", as\n' +
    '        associated with words such as "artisan". English words derived from this meaning include artifact,\n' +
    '        artificial, artifice, medical arts, and military arts. However, there are many other colloquial uses of the\n' +
    '        word, all with some relation to its etymology.\n' +
    '        20th-century bottle, Twa peoples, Rwanda. Artistic works may serve practical functions, in addition to their\n' +
    '        decorative value.\n' +
    '        Over time, philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Socrates and Immanuel Kant, among others, questioned the\n' +
    '        meaning of art.[12] Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art: Socrates says that poetry is\n' +
    '        inspired by the muses, and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness\n' +
    '        (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the Phaedrus (265a–c), and yet in the Republic wants to outlaw\n' +
    '        Homer\'s great poetic art, and laughter as well. In Ion, Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer\n' +
    '        that he expresses in the Republic. The dialogue Ion suggests that Homer\'s Iliad functioned in the ancient\n' +
    '        Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literary art that\n' +
    '        can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted.[13]\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        With regards to the literary art and the musical arts, Aristotle considered epic poetry, tragedy, comedy,\n' +
    '        Dithyrambic poetry and music to be mimetic or imitative art, each varying in imitation by medium, object,\n' +
    '        and manner.[14] For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates\n' +
    '        with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for\n' +
    '        instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better\n' +
    '        than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation—through narrative or character, through\n' +
    '        change or no change, and through drama or no drama.[15] Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to\n' +
    '        mankind and constitutes one of mankind\'s advantages over animals.[16]');
